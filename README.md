# Movie Database

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a movie database created with React and an api from themoviedb.org, where users can search for any movie and get movie information on it (cast, crew, genre, summary, etc.). The index displays a list of most popular movies at the time, highest rated movies of all time, and upcoming movies. There is also a search bar to search for any movie and a list of genres as the navbar (recreates the home page, but for different genres).
